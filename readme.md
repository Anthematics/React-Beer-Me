# React Workshop at CSS Dev Conf

Hey Everyone - Wes here. I'll be your instructor for the CSS react workshop. I need you to do a few things before you come to the workshop.

ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ‘‰ Please watch this quick video showing how to get setup for the workshop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT5a23j1pMw

I've put the notes below as well. 

Please don't hesitate to email me back with any questions. We have a big group tomorrow so I'd love to make sure everyone is setup before we start. See you tomorrow!

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed. If you don't have it, or are an older version, you can visit Nodejs.org and download the installer. 
2. Download the starter files + notes:
	* Download the zip here: https://github.com/wesbos/React-Beer-Me/archive/master.zip
3. Have a terminal application ready. The built in terminal works just great though I find Windows users prefer to use CMDER - http://cmder.net/
4. **optional, but helpful:** npm install all dependencies before you come. cd into your `starter-files` directory and type `npm install`. If you aren't comfortable in the terminal, you may wait until the morning of the workshop to get a hand with this. 


If there are any questions, feel free to email me! wes@wesbos.com
